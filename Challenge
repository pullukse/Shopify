# Question 1
a.	The result of $3145.13 comes from taking the average of the order_amount column. 
However, we must calculate AOV based on the total revenue from the month divided by total orders placed that month i.e., $357.92.
b. I would suggest analyzing: 
  i.Store performance: sales per store sliced by order_amount, total_items, created_at to evaluate store performance throughout the month
  ii.Method performance: sales per user sliced by total_items, order_amount, payment_method to see if method has any role in sales performance 
  iii.User performance: sales per user sliced by order_amount, total_items, created_at to evaluate user spending throughout the month
c.	See answer a

#Question 2
a.	SELECT COUNT(OrderID)
    FROM [Orders]
    WHERE ShipperID = '1'

Result is 54

b.	SELECT Orders.EmployeeID,
    COUNT(OrderID),
    Employees.LastName
    FROM Employees
    INNER JOIN Orders ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
    GROUP BY Orders.EmployeeID,Employees.LastName

Employee with the last name Peacock has the most orders i.e., 40

c.	SELECT Country, ProductID, SUM(Quantity) AS TOTAL
    FROM ((Orders
    INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID)
    INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
    WHERE Country = 'Germany'
    GROUP BY OrderDetails.ProductID
    ORDER BY TOTAL DESC;

Product ID 40 i.e., Boston Crab Meat, is ordered the most in Germany with a total of 160
